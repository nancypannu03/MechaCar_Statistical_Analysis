## Part 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![Test Image](/Resources/linear_regression.png)

1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

## Part 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
 write a short summary using screenshots from your total_summary and lot_summary dataframes, and address the following question:

1. The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

## Part 3: T-Test on Suspension Coils
create a subheading ## T-Tests on Suspension Coils, then briefly summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary.

## Part 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition
1. A metric to be tested is mentioned 
2. A null hypothesis or an alternative hypothesis is described 
3. A statistical test is described to test the hypothesis 
4. The data for the statistical test is described
